Ryan Pauly - COSC 425 - Project 1

Folder CS_425_Project1 contains all the programming .py files and the shuffedData.csv file. 

shuffledAndCleanData.py performs file I/O, reading in the auto-mpg.data file and then samples and 
	shuffles the data into a csv file for the other programs.

	I included the shuffledData.csv which contains the shuffled dataset used and analyzed in the report. 
	Running this program will overwrite it.

project1.py is the non-standardized multivariate linear regression program.

standardized.py is the standardized multivariate linear regression program.
